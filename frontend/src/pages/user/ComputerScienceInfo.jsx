      <h2>About Computer Science</h2>
      <p>
        Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. 
        It covers both theory and practical applications, focusing on how 
        software and hardware interact to process information and solve problems.
      </p>

      <h3>Brief History</h3>
      <p>
        The foundations of Computer Science date back to the early 20th century, 
        with pioneers like Alan Turing, who introduced the concept of algorithms 
        and computation. Since then, the field has rapidly evolved â€” from the 
        invention of the first computers to todayâ€™s advancements in artificial 
        intelligence, big data, and cloud computing.
